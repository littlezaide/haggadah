## Lighting the Festival Lights ##

To symbolize the joy of passover, another sederboss (who may or may not be a woman though traditionally it was the woman but judaism can be kinda oppressive so how about there's just two sederbosses any either can do whatever) lights them candles and recites the following:

*Baruch attah adonoi elohenu melech ha‘olom asher kid’shanu b’mitzvotav v’tzivanu l’hadlik ner shel (on sabbath add: shabbos v’shel) yom tov.*

*Baruch attah adonoi elohenu melech ho‘olom shehekhiyanu v’kiy’manu v’higianu lazman hazzeh.*

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments, and hast commanded us to kindle the (on Sabbath add: Sabbath and) festival lights.

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast kept us alive and sustained us and brought us to this season.

May our home be consecrated, O God, by the light of Thy countenance, shining upon us in blessing, and bringing us peace!

**Company:** Amen.

## Kadesh ##

**On Sabbath eve begin here.**

The sederboss of the house lifts up the wine-cup and says:

LET US praise God and thank Him for all the blessings of the week that is gone; for life, health and strength; for home, love and friendship; for the discipline of our trials and temptations; for the happiness of our success and prosperity. Thou hast ennobled us, O God, by the blessings of work, and in love and grace sanctified us by the blessings of rest, through the commandment, "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath unto the Lord thy God".

**On weekdays begin here.**

With song and praise, and with the symbols of our feast, let us renew the memories of our past.

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast chosen us from all peoples and exalted anti sanctified us with Thy commandments. In love hast Thou given us, O Lord our God, solemn days of joy and festive seasons of gladness, even this day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, a holy convocation unto us, a memorial of the departure from Egypt. Thou hast chosen us for Thy service and hast made us sharers in the blessings of Thy holy festivals. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who sanctifiest Israel and the festive seasons.

**All read in unison:**

*Baruch attah adonoi elohenu melech ha‘olam bor-ay p’ri ha'gafen.*

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, Ruler of the world, who hast created the fruit of the vine.

**Drink the first cup of wine.**

2. ‏כַּרְפַּס‎

Some parsley, lettuce or watercress (YUM) is distributed to errybody, who's expected to dip it in saltwater or vinegar and eat it **say in unison:**

*Baruch atto adonai elohenu melech ha‘olom bor-ay p’ri ha’adomo.*

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Creator of the fruit of the earth.

3. ‏יַֽחַץ‎

The sederboss breaks the middle Matzah, leaving one half on the Seder-dish, but then hiding the other half as the Afikoman to be eaten at the end of the meal. GO LOOK FOR IT KIDS there's money in that tharr Afikoman!

4. ‏מַגִּיר‎

**The sederboss lifts the Matzahs and says:**

This is the bread of affliction which our fathers ate in the land of Egypt. Let all who are hungry come and eat. Let all who are in want come and celebrate the Passover with us. May it be God's will to redeem us from all trouble and from all servitude. Next year at this season, may the whole house of Israel be free!

**The sederboss replaces the dish upon the table.**

## The Four Questions ##

**The youngest person at the table asks:**

WHY IS this night different from all other nights?

1. On all other nights, we eat either leavened or unleavened bread. Why, on this night, do we eat only unleavened bread?

2. On all other nights, we eat all kinds of herbs. Why, on this night, do we eat especially bitter herbs?

3. On all other nights, we do not dip herbs in any condiment. Why, on this night, do we dip them in salt water and ḥaroses?

4. On all other nights, we eat without special festivities. Why, on this night, do we hold this Seder service?

**The sederboss answers:**

We celebrate tonight because Pharaoh enslaved us in Egypt, and the Lord delivered us out of there. Had he not, we'd probably be still be slaves. So even if all of us were wise and knew the Torah super well, it would still be our duty to tell the story of our deliverance from Egypt every year. As Martha Stewart once coined: "it's a good thing".

## The Four Children ##

The Torah explains the meaning of the seder's celebration through the "four children" archetypes (the torah uses "sons" but that's weird since daughters exist, so let's just go with children):

First the wise child. She asks eagerly about all the different things and symbols. To her you say "we do this to remember how we bad things once were Jews we were slaves in Egypt, and to appreciate how that isn't the case anymore. 

The wicked child mockingly asks "what do you get out of this?" He deliberately says "you"--not "we" and excludes himself from the table. Strangely, the Torah suggests that you turn on this child, ironically excluding him from the current group as punishment. Perhaps simply saying the same thing you told the wise child would suffice: "being slaves sucked, and we appreciate not being slaves."

The simple child indifferently asks: "What is this?". Here, it seems explaining to her in a similar and  perhaps simpler way will suffice: "Slavery bad; non-slavery good".

And for the child who doesn't even no how to ask, the Torah suggests telling him the whole passover story (though perhaps the epic Charlton Heston movie will do) and then explain as you did with all your children that we celebrate passover to celebrate freedom from bondage.

## Oppression ##

Oppression: a tale as old as time. It is something we as jews (and not just jews) have faced from tyrants for about 5778 years. Thankfully, we keep escaping it, procreating, and multiplying. 

Today's Oppression story-du-jour is that involving the Egyptians. We lived there in small numbers, multiplied a bit, but one day the new Egyptian king was displeased by our presence, demanding they curb our growth. They tried and tried again and failed. So, they enslaved us. Still we prevailed as the Lord brought us out of there with help from Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. He commanded then that we observe Passover every year, passed on from generation to generation.

**All read in unison:**

Who is like unto Thee, O Lord, among the mighty?  
Who is like unto Thee, glorious in holiness,  
Fearful in praises, doing wonders?  
The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.

## Dayenu ##

Dayenu‎

**The company repeats the refrain "*Dayenu*" which is equivalent to "It would have satisfied us".**

How manifold are the favors which God has conferred upon us!

HAD HE brought us out of Egypt, and not divided the sea for us, *Dayenu*!

HAD HE divided the sea, and not permitted us to cross on dry land, *Dayenu*!

HAD HE permitted us to cross the sea on dry land, and not sustained us for forty years in the desert, *Dayenu*!

HAD HE sustained us for forty years in the desert, and not fed us with manna, *Dayenu*!

HAD HE fed us with manna, and not ordained the Sabbath, *Dayenu*!

HAD HE ordained the Sabbath, and not brought us to Mount Sinai, *Dayenu*!

HAD HE brought us to Mount Sinai, and not given us the Torah, *Dayenu*!

HAD HE given us the Torah, and not led us into the Land of Israel, *Dayenu*!

HAD HE led us into the Land of Israel, and not built for us the Temple, *Dayenu*!

HAD HE built for us the Temple, and not sent us prophets of truth, *Dayenu*!

HAD HE sent us prophets of truth, and not made us a holy people, *Dayenu*!

All read in unison:

How much more then are we to be grateful unto the Lord for the manifold favors which He has bestowed upon us! He brought us out of Egypt, divided the Red Sea for us, permitted us to cross on dry land, sustained us for forty years in the desert, fed us with manna, ordained the Sabbath, brought us to Mount Sinai, gave us the Torah, led us into the Land of Israel, built for us the Temple, sent unto us prophets of truth, and made us a holy people to perfect the world under the kingdom of the Almighty, in truth and in righteousness.

## Symbols ##

Should enemies again assail us, the remembrance of the exodus of our fathers from Egypt will never fail to inspire us with new courage, and the symbols of this festival will help to strengthen our faith in God, who redeems the oppressed.

Therefore, Rabban Gamaliel, a noted sage, declared: "Whoever does not well consider the meaning of these three symbols: Pesaḥ, Matzah and Moror, has not truly celebrated this Festival".

### Pesakh ###

**One of the company asks:**

What is the meaning of Pesakh?

**The sederboss lifts up the roasted shank-bone and answers:**

Pesakh means the Paschal Lamb, and is symbolized by this shank-bone. It was eaten by our fathers while the Temple was in existence, as a memorial of God's favors, as it is said: "It is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover, for that He passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when He smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses". As God in the ancient "Watch-Night" passed over and spared the houses of Israel, so did He save us in all kinds of distress, and so may He always shield the afflicted, and for ever remove every trace of bondage from among the children of man.

### Matzah ###

**One of the company asks:**

What is the meaning of Matzah?

**The sederboss lifts up the Matzah and answers:**

Matzah, called The Bread Of Affliction, was the hasty provision that our fathers made for their journey, as it is said: "And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt. There was not sufficient time to leaven it, for they were driven out of Egypt and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any provisions." The bread which of necessity they baked unleavened, thus became a symbol of divine help.
MOROR

**One of the company asks:**

And what is the meaning of Moror?

**The sederboss lifts up the bitter herbs and answers:**

Moror means Bitter Herb. We eat it in order to recall that the lives of our ancestors were embittered by the Egyptians, as we read: 'And they made their lives bitter with hard labor in mortar and bricks and in all manner of field labor. Whatever task was imposed upon them, was executed with the utmost rigor." As we eat it in the midst of the festivities of this night, we rejoice in the heroic spirit which trials developed in our people. Instead of becoming embittered by them, they were sustained and strengthened.

## The Night Before ##

IN EVERY generation, each Jew should regard himself as though he too were brought out of Egypt. Not our fathers alone, but us also, did the Holy One redeem; for not alone in Egypt but in many other lands, have we groaned under the burden of affliction and suffered as victims of malice, ignorance and fanaticism. This very night which we, a happy generation, celebrate so calmly and safely and joyfully in our habitations was often turned into a night of anxiety and of suffering for our people in former times. Cruel mobs were ready to rush upon them and to destroy their homes and the fruit of their labors. But undauntedly they clung to their faith in the ultimate triumph of right and of freedom. Champions of God, they marched from one Egypt into another—driven in haste, their property a prey to the rapacious foe, with their bundles on their shoulders, and God in their hearts.

Because God, "the Guardian of Israel, who sleepeth not nor slumbereth" revealed Himself on that Watch-night in Egypt and in all dark periods of our past, as the Redeemer of the enslaved, we keep this as a Watch-night for all the Children of Israel, dedicated to God our redeemer.

While enjoying the liberty of this land, let us strive to make secure also our spiritual freedom, that, as the delivered, we may become the deliverer, carrying out Israel's historic task of being the messenger of religion unto all mankind.

**All read in unison:**

So it is our duty to thank, praise and glorify God, who brought us and our forefathers from slavery unto freedom, from sorrow unto joy, from mourning unto festive gladness, from darkness unto light. Let us therefore proclaim His praise.

## Blessings ##

PRAISED art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast redeemed us and our ancestors from Egypt, and hast enabled us to observe this night of the Passover, the Feast of Unleavened Bread. O Lord our God and God of our fathers, may we, with Thy help, live to celebrate other feasts and holy seasons. May we rejoice in Thy salvation and be gladdened by Thy righteousness. Grant deliverance to mankind through Israel, Thy people. May Thy will be done through Jacob, Thy chosen servant, so that Thy name shall be sanctified in the midst of all the earth, and that all peoples be moved to worship Thee with one accord. And we shall sing new songs of praise unto Thee, for our redemption and for the deliverance of our souls. Praised art Thou, O God, Redeemer of Israel.

**The cups are filled for the second time.**

**All read in unison:**

*Baruch atto adonoi elohenu melech ho‘olom bore p’ri haggofen.*

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast created the fruit of the vine.

**Drink the second cup of wine.**

5. ‏מוֹצִיא, מַצָּה‎

**The upper Matzah is broken and distributed. All then read in unison:**

*Boruch atto adonoi elohenu melech ho‘olom hamotzi leḥem min ho’oretz.*

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who bringest forth bread from the earth.

*Boruch atto adonoi elohenu melech ho‘olom asher kidd’shonu b’mitzvosov v’tzivonu al achilas matzo.*

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us through Thy commandments, and ordained that we should eat unleavened bread.

**Eat the Matzah.**

6. ‏כּוֹרֵךְ מָרוֹר‎

**Each person receives some bitter herbs and ḥaroses, which he places between two pieces of matzo. The sederboss then reads:**

This was the practice of Hillel, at the time the Temple was still in existence. He combined the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs and ate them together, to carry out the injunction concerning the Passover sacrifice: "With unleavened bread and with bitter herbs, they shall eat it."

**All read in unison:**

*Boruch atto adonoi elohenu melech ho‘olom asher kidd’shonu b’mitzvosov v’tzivonu al achilas moror.*

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments, and ordained that we should eat bitter herbs.

**Eat the Moror.**

7. ‏שֻׁלְחָן עוֹרֵךְ‎

SUPPER IS SERVED.

8. ‏צָפוּן‎

Aphikoman.

At the conclusion of the meal, the children are given an opportunity to find the Aphikomon. The reader redeems it and distributes pieces of it to all present.

After partaking of the Aphikoman, it is customary to eat nothing else.
