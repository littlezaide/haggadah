# Before the Meal

## setting the table ##

On the table, in front of the "sederboss", should be a large platter containing Seder symbols:

1. Ya got three matzos (or if not, Saltines or some "unleavened thing that approximates matzoh"), each covered separately by a napkin or cute looking cover. These happen to represent the three religious divisions of Israel: the "Cohanim" (priests), "Levi'im" (associate priests/musicians) and "Yisroel" (lay-Israelite).
2. Ya got a roasted shank-bone (of a lamb) or something that approximates it.
3. And ya got a roasted egg.

Besides these, lay down some:

1. bitter herbs (horseradish)
2. kharoset (or how about just a Clif bar?)
3. parsley or something green. Any herb. Lettuce? Cabbage? fine.
4. salt water

[Put a cup of wine at each plate, and a goblet in the center of the table for Elijah.]

## Seder ##

All good meetings have agendas, and this one is no different. There are fifteen steps, and for the impatient among you most of these are pretty short.

1. Kadesh: the recitation of Kiddush.
2. Urchatz: washing the hands.
3. Karpas: eating a vegetable dipped in salt-water.
4. Yachatz: breaking of the middle matzo.
5. Maggid: telling the Pesakh story.
6. Rachtzah: washing of the hands a second time.
7. Motze: blessing before the meal.
8. Matzah: blessing al Achilas matzo, eating the matzo.
9. Morror: eating the bitter herbs.
10. Korech: eating a sandwich of matzo and bitter herbs.
11. Shulchan Oruch: festival meal.
12. Tzafun: eating the afikomen.
13. Bayrech: grace.
14. Hallel: the recitation of Hallel psalms of praise.
15. Nirtzah: conclusion

## Lighting the Festival Lights ##

To symbolize the joy of passover, another sederboss (who may or may not be a woman though traditionally it was the woman but judaism can be kinda oppressive so how about there's just two sederbosses and either can do whatever) lights the candles and recites the following:

*Baruch attah adonoi elohenu melech ha‘olom asher kid’shanu b’mitzvotav v’tzivanu l’hadlik ner shel (on sabbath add: shabbos v’shel) yom tov.*

*Baruch attah adonoi elohenu melech ho‘olom shehekhiyanu v’kiy’manu v’higianu lazman hazzeh.*

**[EVERYONE]:** Amen.

## 1. Kadesh ##

**[SEDERBOSS, READ ON SHABBOS ONLY!]**

The sederboss of the house lifts up the wine-cup and says:

LET US praise God and thank Him for all the blessings of the week that is gone; for life, health and strength; for home, love and friendship; for the discipline of our trials and temptations; for the happiness of our success and prosperity. Thou hast ennobled us, O God, by the blessings of work, and in love and grace sanctified us by the blessings of rest, through the commandment, "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath unto the Lord thy God".

**[SEDERBOSS, READ ON NON-SHABBOS ONLY!]**

With song and praise, and with the symbols of our feast, let us renew the memories of our past.

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast chosen us from all peoples and exalted anti sanctified us with Thy commandments. In love hast Thou given us, O Lord our God, solemn days of joy and festive seasons of gladness, even this day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, a holy convocation unto us, a memorial of the departure from Egypt. Thou hast chosen us for Thy service and hast made us sharers in the blessings of Thy holy festivals. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who sanctifiest Israel and the festive seasons.

**[EVERYONE read in unison:]**

*Baruch attah adonoi elohenu melech ha‘olam bor-ay p’ri ha'gafen.*

**[EVERYONE drink the first cup of wine.]**

2. Urchatz 

Wash your hands bit do not say the brakha. 

3. ‏כַּרְפַּס‎ / Karpas

Some parsley, lettuce or whatever you want frankly (YUM) is distributed to errybody, who's expected to dip it in saltwater or vinegar and eat it. **[EVERYONE say in unison:]**

*Baruch atto adonai elohenu melech ha‘olom bor-ay p’ri ha’adomo.*

3. ‏יַֽחַץ‎

The sederboss breaks the middle Matzah (or Saltine!), leaving one half on the Seder-dish, but then hiding the other half as the Afikoman to be eaten at the end of the meal. (KEEP A KEEN EYE OUT FOR IT KIDS there's money in that there Afikoman!)

4. ‏מַגִּיר‎

**[SEDERBOSS! lift that matzo and say:]**

Our ancestors in egypt ate this meager bread which is basically a big cracker, and not fluffy and doughy at all. Let all those hungry and seeking fellowship come and hang out, eat, and celebrate Passover with us. We're here, but next year we hope to be in Israel, truly free! (realistically, though, save for quarantine, it feels pretty free here in Canada too!)

**[SEDERBOSS! replace the dish upon the table.]**

## The Four Questions ##

**[YOUNGEST AT THE TABLE (BUT PROBABLY ACTUALLY JILL) read below]:**

How come tonight's different from all other nights?

1. Normally, we don't limit how fluffy we make and eat our bread. How come tonight we eat only fluffless cracker-bread called Matzoh?

2. Normally, we don't make deliberate decisions about the types of herbs and vegetables we eat based on historical events. How come tonight we eat especially bitter herbs?

3. Normally, we don't dip herbs twice in any condiment. How come tonight we specifically dip them once in salt water and then later in ḥaroseth?

4. Normally, we eat with whatever natural posture we please. Why, on this night, do we deliberately recline?

**[SEDERBOSS: time for your nuanced, thought-provoking answers:]**

We celebrate tonight because Pharaoh enslaved us in Egypt, and we were delivered out of that hot mess. Had we not been, we'd probably be still be slaves. So even if all of us were wise and knew our history super well, it would still be our duty to tell the story of our deliverance from Egypt every year. As Martha Stewart once coined: "it's a good thing".

## The Four Children ##

The Torah explains the meaning of the seder's celebration through the "four children" archetypes (the torah uses "sons" but that's weirdly exclusive since daughters exist, so let's just go with children and alternate gender pronouns):

First, the wise child. She asks eagerly about all the different things and symbols. To her you say "we do this to remember how bad things once were for Jews, when we were slaves in Egypt, and to appreciate how that isn't the case anymore. 

The wicked child boorishly and contemptuously asks "what do you get out of this?" He deliberately says "you"--not "we" and excludes himself from the table. Strangely, the Torah suggests that you turn his biting sarcasm right back at him, ironically excluding him from the current group by saying "I was saved from egypt" and not "WE were saved". This seems a bit childish and unnecessarily punishing, no?  Perhaps modern parenting ideals would advise setting an example by simply saying the same thing you told the wise child earlier: "being slaves sucked, and we appreciate not being slaves and being free instead."

The simple child indifferently asks: "What is this?". Here, it seems explaining to her in a similar and perhaps simpler way will suffice: "Slavery bad; non-slavery good".

And for the child who doesn't even no how to ask, the Torah suggests telling him the whole passover story (though perhaps putting on the epic Charlton Heston Ten Commandments film will do) and then explain as you did with all your children that we celebrate passover to celebrate freedom from bondage.

## Oppression ##

The answer to the wise child's question is found by referring first to oppression: a tale as old as time. Oppression is something we as jews (but also not just jews) have faced from tyrants for about 5780 years. Thankfully, we keep escaping it, procreating, and multiplying. 

Today's oppression story-du-jour is about the oppression and bondage the Egyptians inflicted on us. We lived in Egypt in small numbers, multiplied a bit, and one day the new Egyptian king was displeased by our presence. The king demanded the non-Jewish Egyptians curb our growth—and they hoped—eventually exterminate us. They tried and tried again and failed. So, they enslaved us. Still, we prevailed and escaped with help from Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. To celebrate, we observe Passover annually, passed on from generation to generation. 

## The Plagues ##

Much ink (and wine) has been spilled debating how many plagues were actually inflicted on the Egyptians. Rabbi Jose \[pronounce awkwardly in a Spanish way all you want, it really is "Yo-SAY"\] the Galilean thinks it was about fifty plagues. Rabbi Eliezar thinks Jose really underestimated things, and actually it was around 200 plagues. Not to be outdone, Rabbi Akiba professed it was a whopping 250 plagues. Their interpretations are all frankly pretty confusing. As centuries later we've pretty much all settled on just ten plagues, it is safe to say they're either all wrong, or at least not very persuasive.

Anyway, Rabbi Judah put together a fun little mnemonic using the plagues' initials to remember their order. For some reason, we spill drops for those too, probably as a shout-out to Judah. They are as follows:

1. DZACH; 2. ADASH; 3. Beh-AHAV.

Let's unpack those initials and spill a drop for each individual plague:
1. BLOOD | DAM
2. FROGS | TZ-FAR-DEY-YA
3. VERMIN | KEE-NEEM
4. WILD BEASTS | A-ROV
5. PESTILENCE | DEH-VER
6. BOILS | SH'KHEEN
7. HAIL | BA-RAD
8. LOCUSTS | AR-BEH
9. DARKNESS | HO-SHEKH
10. SLAYING THE FIRST BORN | MA-KAT BEH-KHO-ROHT

## Dayenu ##

Dayenu‎ (The abridged version!)

**[EVERYONE: repeats the refrain "*Dayenu*" which is equivalent to "It would have satisfied us".]**

How many favors has God has bestowed on us!

HAD HE brought us out of Egypt, and not inflicted plagues on the Egyptians? That would have been enough for us *Dayenu*!

HAD HE inflicted plagues on the Egyptians, and not destroyed their idols? That would have been enough for us *Dayenu*!

HAD HE given us the Sabbath, and not brought us to Mount Sinai? That would have been enough for us *Dayenu*!

HAD HE given us the Torah, and not brought us to Israel? That would have been enough for us *Dayenu*!

## Symbols ##

Symbols are great. They help us remember, and Rabban Gamliel, a noted sage, declared: "Whoever does not well consider the meaning of these three symbols: Pesaḥ, Matzah and Moror, has not truly celebrated this Festival". Let's consider them, lest we disappoint Gamliel.

### Pesakh - the sacrificial passover lamb ###

First off: what is the meaning of Pesakh?

**[SEDERBOSS! lift up the roasted shank-bone and answer:]**

Pesakh refers to the sacrifical Lamb, and is symbolized by this shank-bone. Our ancestors ate them while the Temple was in existence, as a sacrifice for Passover, since the jewish houses were passed over when all the Egyptian first born were smote. In so doing, the Lord saved us all kinds of distress, and so the sacrificial lamb has become symbolic of the hope that we always be shielded from affliction, and that every trace of slavery and oppression is always and forever extinguished from humanity.

### Matzah - the unleavened rushed crackerbread ###

Second: what is the meaning of Matzah?

**[SEDERBOSS lift up the matzo and answer]**

Matzah, called "The Bread Of Affliction", is what resulted when we rushed out of Egypt. We couldn't dilly-dally, and we hadn't prepared any provisions earlier. We simply had to get outta there, and this was our bread of necessity which is symbolic of our exodus from egypt.

### Moror - the bitter herbs ###

Third: what is the meaning of Moror?

**[SEDERBOSS lift up the bitter herbs and answer:]**

Moror means Bitter Herb. We eat it to recall that the Egyptians ancestors literally "embittered" our ancestors' lives. Maror has become symbolic of our rejoicing in the Jewish spirit, rejecting embitterment and instead being strengthened by the trials we've had to endure. Also, nothing cleans out the sinuses like a mountain of horseradish. Reject pollen and breathe in that delicious spring air!

## The Night Before ##

IN EVERY generation, each Jew should regard herself as though she too were brought out of Egypt. And not just Egypt but in many other lands, have we moaned and groaned under the burden of affliction and suffered as victims of malice, ignorance, and fanaticism. 

Typically, we celebrate calmly, safely, and joyfully as a happy generation, remembering nights of anxiety and our people's suffering in former times. Cruel mobs were ready to rush upon our ancestors and destroy their homes and the fruits of their labors. Undauntedly, jews clung to faith in the ultimate triumph of right and of freedom. Champions, they marched from one Egypt into another—driven hastily, their property a prey to the rapacious foe, with their bundles on their shoulders, and faith in their hearts. 

Tonight, however, provides a germane example. While no human mobs are creepin' outside, we can relate more than previous seders to our ancesters as we feel unsafe and fearful of the hazards beyond our doors, of threats to our well-being and economic security and those of our families and loved ones. And yet, despite our physical limitations, we continue to enjoy general physical liberty from bondage, and spiritual and intellectual freedom that our ancestors did not. Let's continue to strive to secure those freedoms perpetually for ourselves and every other group and culture.

## Blessings ##

PRAISED art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast redeemed us and our ancestors from Egypt, and hast enabled us to observe this night of the Passover, the Feast of Unleavened Bread. O Lord our God and God of our fathers, may we, with Thy help, live to celebrate other feasts and holy seasons. May we rejoice in Thy salvation and be gladdened by Thy righteousness. Grant deliverance to mankind through Israel, Thy people. May Thy will be done through Jacob, Thy chosen servant, so that Thy name shall be sanctified in the midst of all the earth, and that all peoples be moved to worship Thee with one accord. And we shall sing new songs of praise unto Thee, for our redemption and for the deliverance of our souls. Praised art Thou, O God, Redeemer of Israel.

**[EVERYONE get those wine glasses filled now, for behold: the 2nd cup!]**

**[EVERYONE read in unison]**

*Baruch atto adonoi elohenu melech ho‘olom bore p’ri haggofen.*

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast created the fruit of the vine.

**[EVERYONE drink the second cup of wine.]**

5. ‏מוֹצִיא, מַצָּה‎

**[break the upper matzo and distribute among all. EVERYONE: read in unison]**

*Boruch atto adonoi elohenu melech ho‘olom hamotzi leḥem min ho’oretz.*

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us through Thy commandments, and ordained that we should eat unleavened bread.

**[EVERYONE eat the matzah.]**

6. ‏כּוֹרֵךְ מָרוֹר‎

This was the practice of Hillel, at the time the Temple was still in existence. He combined the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs and ate them together, to carry out the injunction concerning the Passover sacrifice: "With unleavened bread and with bitter herbs, they shall eat it."

**[EVERYONE read in unison]**

*Boruch atto adonoi elohenu melech ho‘olom asher kidd’shonu b’mitzvosov v’tzivonu al achilas moror.*

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments, and ordained that we should eat bitter herbs.

7. ‏שֻׁלְחָן עוֹרֵךְ‎

**[EVERYONE eat!]**

8. ‏צָפוּן‎

Afikoman.

At the conclusion of the meal, the children are given an opportunity to find the Afikoman. The reader redeems it and distributes pieces of it to all present.

After partaking of the Afikoman, it is customary to eat nothing else.

**[EVERYONE Drink 2 more cups of wine, cause we don't usually do the after supper stuff.]**
